Subject: [PATCH 06/24] kexec: Disable at runtime if the kernel is locked down

kexec permits the loading and execution of arbitrary code in ring 0, which
is something that lock-down is meant to prevent. It makes sense to disable
kexec in this situation.

This does not affect kexec_file_load() which can check for a signature on the
image to be booted.
