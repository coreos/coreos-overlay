+Masahiro, Michal.

I've got it wrong. *Any* LDFLAGS option passed to make this way:

  make LDFLAGS="..."

would cause a issue. Even empty.

It overrides all assignments to the variable in the makefile.
As result the image is built without -pie and linker doesn't generate
position independed code.

Looks like the patch below helps, but my make-fu is poor.
I don't see many override directives in kernel makefiles.
It makes me think that there's a better way to fix this.

Hm?
