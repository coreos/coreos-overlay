# OverlayDepth is a 32-bit integer which is used to control overlay
# stacking order.  The overlay with the lowest depth is in front of
# all others.  This value has meaning only when multiple overlays are
# present on a display. This value can range between 0 & 255 (both values
# inclusive). The default being 255.

#    Option      "OverlayDepth" "0"

# OverlayCombineMode determines how the X overlay is combined with the
# overlay behind it during scanout.  Available modes are: Opaque
# (default), SourceAlphaBlend, and PremultSourceAlphaBlend.  This
# value has meaning only when an external process has created a
# display which is behind the X server.

#    Option      "OverlayCombineMode" "PremultSourceAlphaBlend"

# ARGBHWCursor controls whether the X driver uses an overlay to
# display 32-bit "true-color" cursors, or whether such cursors are
# emulated in software.  Valid values are "true" to enable hardware
# cursors, and "false" (default) to disable them.

    Option      "ARGBHWCursor" "true"

# Set the maximum number of pixmap caches used by the X driver.
# Valid values are 0 through 16 (default)
# A value of 0 disables the use of the caches for pixmaps.
# To use less memory, but still retain performance, the recommendation
# is to use one pixmap heap, set a small size, and limit the size
# of the surfaces that utilizes the pixmap cache.
#    Option      "PixmapCacheMaxHeaps"  "1"

# Set the size of each pixmap cache, in bytes.
# Valid values are 64 KiB though 64 MiB. Up to
# "PixmapCacheMaxHeaps" (see above) will be allocated
# if necessary. The default value is 8 MiB.
#    Option      "PixmapCacheSize"  "65536"

# Set the maximum size for a surface that uses
# the pixmap cache. If a surface exceeds this size
# it will be allocated as a separate allocation, outside
# the pixmap cache.
# The default value is the same as "PixmapCacheSize"
#    Option      "PixmapCacheMaxSurfaceSize"  "4096"

# Use monitor section with identifier LVDS for output named LVDS-1
#    Option      "monitor-LVDS-1" "LVDS"
#    Option      "monitor-HDMI-1" "HDMI"
