# @ECLASS: cros-workon.eclass
# @BLURB: helper eclass for building CoreOS SDK provided source
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Instead of cloning git trees directly from github ebuilds can fetch
# from the local cache maintained by repo. Additionally live builds can
# build directly from the source checked out in the repo tree.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_REPO
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git URL which is prefixed to CROS_WORKON_PROJECT
: ${CROS_WORKON_REPO:=https://chromium.googlesource.com}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_PROJECT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git project name which is suffixed to CROS_WORKON_REPO
: ${CROS_WORKON_PROJECT:=${PN}}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_LOCALDIR
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Repo checkout directory which is prefixed to CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME
# Generally is either src/third_party or src/platform
: ${CROS_WORKON_LOCALDIR:=src/third_party}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Directory name which is suffixed to CROS_WORKON_LOCALDIR
: ${CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME:=${PN}}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_COMMIT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git commit to checkout to
: ${CROS_WORKON_COMMIT:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_TREE
# @DESCRIPTION:
# SHA1 of the contents of the repository. This is used for verifying the
# correctness of prebuilts. Unlike the commit hash, this SHA1 is unaffected
# by the history of the repository, or by commit messages.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SRCROOT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Directory where chrome third party and platform sources are located (formerly CHROMEOS_ROOT)

# These have never been used in CoreOS.
