# @BLURB: helper eclass for building ChromiumOS packages from git
# @DESCRIPTION:
# A lot of ChromiumOS packages (src/platform/ and src/third_party/) are
# managed in the same way.  You've got a git tree and you want to build
# it.  This automates a lot of that common stuff in one place.


# Array variables. All of the following variables can contain multiple items
# with the restriction being that all of them have to have either:
# - the same number of items globally
# - one item as default for all
# - no items as the cros-workon default
# The exception is CROS_WORKON_PROJECT which has to have all items specified.
ARRAY_VARIABLES=( CROS_WORKON_{SUBDIR,REPO,PROJECT,LOCALDIR,LOCALNAME,DESTDIR,COMMIT,TREE} )

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SUBDIR
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Sub-directory which is added to create full source checkout path
: ${CROS_WORKON_SUBDIR:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_REPO
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git URL which is prefixed to CROS_WORKON_PROJECT
: ${CROS_WORKON_REPO:=https://chromium.googlesource.com}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_PROJECT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git project name which is suffixed to CROS_WORKON_REPO
: ${CROS_WORKON_PROJECT:=${PN}}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_LOCALDIR
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Repo checkout directory which is prefixed to CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME
# Generally is either src/third_party or src/platform
: ${CROS_WORKON_LOCALDIR:=src/third_party}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Directory name which is suffixed to CROS_WORKON_LOCALDIR
: ${CROS_WORKON_LOCALNAME:=${PN}}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_DESTDIR
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Destination directory in ${WORKDIR} for checkout.
# Note that the default is ${S}, but is only referenced in src_unpack for
# ebuilds that would like to override it.
: ${CROS_WORKON_DESTDIR:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_COMMIT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Git commit to checkout to
: ${CROS_WORKON_COMMIT:=master}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_TREE
# @DESCRIPTION:
# SHA1 of the contents of the repository. This is used for verifying the
# correctness of prebuilts. Unlike the commit hash, this SHA1 is unaffected
# by the history of the repository, or by commit messages.
: ${CROS_WORKON_TREE:=}

# Scalar variables. These variables modify the behaviour of the eclass.

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_TO_COPY
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Make cros-workon operate exclusively with the subtrees given by this array.
# NOTE: This only speeds up local_cp builds. Inplace/local_git builds are unaffected.
# It will also be disabled by using project arrays, rather than a single project.
: ${CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_TO_COPY:=/}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_BLACKLIST
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Array of directories in the source tree to explicitly ignore and not even copy
# them over. This is intended, for example, for blocking infamous bloated and
# generated content that is unwanted during the build.
: ${CROS_WORKON_SUBDIRS_BLACKLIST:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_SRCROOT
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Directory where chrome third party and platform sources are located (formerly CHROMEOS_ROOT)
: ${CROS_WORKON_SRCROOT:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_INPLACE
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Build the sources in place. Don't copy them to a temp dir.
: ${CROS_WORKON_INPLACE:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_USE_VCSID
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Export VCSID into the project
: ${CROS_WORKON_USE_VCSID:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_GIT_SUFFIX
# @DESCRIPTION:
# The git eclass does not do locking on its repo.  That means
# multiple ebuilds that use the same git repo cannot safely be
# emerged at the same time.  Until we can get that sorted out,
# allow ebuilds that know they'll conflict to declare a unique
# path for storing the local clone.
: ${CROS_WORKON_GIT_SUFFIX:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_OUTOFTREE_BUILD
# @DESCRIPTION:
# Do not copy the source tree to $S; instead set $S to the
# source tree and store compiled objects and build state
# in $WORKDIR.  The ebuild is responsible for ensuring
# the build output goes to $WORKDIR, e.g. setting
# O=${WORKDIR}/${P}/build/${board} when compiling the kernel.
: ${CROS_WORKON_OUTOFTREE_BUILD:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_INCREMENTAL_BUILD
# @DESCRIPTION:
# If set to "1", store output objects in a location that is not wiped
# between emerges.  If disabled, objects will be written to ${WORKDIR}
# like normal.
: ${CROS_WORKON_INCREMENTAL_BUILD:=}

# @ECLASS-VARIABLE: CROS_WORKON_BLACKLIST
# @DESCRIPTION:
# If set to "1", the cros-workon uprev system on the bots will not automatically
# revbump your package when changes are made.  This is useful if you want more
# direct control over when updates to the source git repo make it into the
# ebuild, or if the git repo you're using is not part of the official manifest.
# e.g. If you set CROS_WORKON_REPO or EGIT_REPO_URI to an external (to Google)
# site, set this to "1".
: ${CROS_WORKON_BLACKLIST:=}
