# Purpose: Library for handling building of ChromiumOS packages
#
#
#  This class sets the BOARD environment variable.  It is intended to
#  be used by ebuild packages that need to have the board information
#  for various reasons -- for example, to differentiate various
#  hardware attributes at build time; see 'adhd' for an example of
#  this.
#
#  When set, the BOARD environment variable should conform to the
#  syntax used by the CROS utilities.
#
#  If an unknown board is encountered, this class deliberately fails
#  the build; this provides an easy method of identifying a change to
#  the build which might affect inheriting packages.
#
#  For example, the ADHD (Google A/V daemon) package relies on the
#  BOARD variable to determine which hardware should be monitored at
#  runtime.  If the BOARD variable is not set, the daemon will not
#  monitor any specific hardware; thus, when a new board is added, the
#  ADHD project must be updated.
