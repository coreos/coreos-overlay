# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

# Use the 3.* series of syslinux, seems to work correctly with the
# chromeos build system for now
>=sys-boot/syslinux-3.90

# libpng security vulnerability fix
<media-libs/libpng-1.2.44

# Replaced by sys-apps/efunctions
coreos-base/efunctions

# There is a "new" sdk toolchain, which can properly build kexec-tools,
# so mask the "binary" ebuild.
=sys-apps/kexec-tools-2.0.99
