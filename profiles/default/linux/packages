# This file extends the base packages file for the default profile that all
# architectures will enjoy.  Please note that default is what most architectures
# will have.  Some will have an selinux profile (see ${PORTDIR}/profiles/selinux).
# The idea is to only create a new family of profiles when absolutely necessary.

# We don't need busybox in our chroot sdk as it is used in upstream Gentoo
# only as a static rescue shell, and that doesn't make sense for us
