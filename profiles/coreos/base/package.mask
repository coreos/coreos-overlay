# The following are here because we override the ebuilds from the
# portage tree for a reason other than adding an ebuild from upstream
# that wasn't yet in our portage tree. We want to keep using our
# version of these packages even if a newer stable version becomes
# available in portage:

>=net-misc/tlsdate-0.0.6

# Stick with python 2 for now
>=dev-lang/python-3

# Require our ca-certificates package based directly on Mozilla's
# certificate store provided in NSS rather than the Gentoo/Debian package.
>=app-misc/ca-certificates-20000000

# stick to openssh 6.9, since 7.0+ disables ssh-dss keys.
