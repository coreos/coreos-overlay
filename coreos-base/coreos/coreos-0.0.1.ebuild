# READ THIS BEFORE ADDING PACKAGES TO THIS EBUILD!
#
################################################################################
#
# Every chromeos dependency (along with its dependencies) is included in the
# release image -- more packages contribute to longer build times, a larger
# image, slower and bigger auto-updates, increased security risks, etc. Consider
# the following before adding a new package:
#
# 1. Does the package really need to be part of the release image?
#
# Some packages can be included only in the developer or test images, i.e., the
# chromeos-dev or chromeos-test ebuilds. If the package will eventually be used
# in the release but it's still under development, consider adding it to
# chromeos-dev initially until it's ready for production.
#
# 2. Why is the package a direct dependency of the chromeos ebuild?
#
# It makes sense for some packages to be included as a direct dependency of the
# chromeos ebuild but for most it doesn't. The package should be added as a
# direct dependency of the ebuilds for all packages that actually use it -- in
# time, this ensures correct builds and allows easier cleanup of obsolete
# packages. For example, if a utility will be invoked by the session manager,
# its package should be added as a dependency in the chromeos-login ebuild. Or
# if the package adds a daemon that will be started through an upstart job, it
# should be added as a dependency in the chromeos-init ebuild. If the package
# really needs to be a direct dependency of the chromeos ebuild, consider adding
# a comment why the package is needed and how it's used.
#
# 3. Are all default package features and dependent packages needed?
#
# The release image should include only packages and features that are needed in
# the production system. Often packages pull in features and additional packages
# that are never used. Review these and consider pruning them (e.g., through USE
# flags).
#
# 4. What is the impact on the image size?
#
# Before adding a package, evaluate the impact on the image size. If the package
# and its dependencies increase the image size significantly, consider
# alternative packages or approaches.
#
# 5. Is the package needed on all targets?
#
# If the package is needed only on some target boards, consider making it
# conditional through USE flags in the board overlays.
